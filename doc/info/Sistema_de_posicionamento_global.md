GPS time = TAI - 19 seconds.  GPS time matched UTC from 1980-01-01 to 1981-07-01.  No leap seconds are inserted into GPS time, thus GPS time is 13 seconds ahead of UTC on 2000-01-01.  The GPS epoch is 00:00 (midnight) UTC on 1980-01-06.

The differences between GPS Time and International Atomic Time (TAI) and Terrestrial Time (TT), also know as Terrestrial Dynamical Time (TDT), are constant at the level of some tens of nanoseconds while the difference between GPS Time and UTC changes in increments of seconds each time a leap second is added to UTC time scale.

GPS week = a numbering of weeks starting at the GPS epoch 1980-01-06 00:00 GPS time (which back then was equal to UTC).  Weeks are numbered from 0 and up until 1023, then it "rolls back" to 0 and are again numbered from 0 and up, etc.  One GPS week rollover cycle is therefore 1024 weeks = 7168 days = ca 19.62 years.  So far there's been two such GPS week number roll-overs, the first on 1999-08-22 00:00 GPS time and the second on 2019-04-07 00:00 GPS time. Some older GPS receivers then ceased to show the correct date/time but could still be useful for giving the correct geographic position.
